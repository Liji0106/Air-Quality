## Project Workflow

    1. Data Preparation
                Data Cleaning:
                        Address missing values with imputation techniques.
                        Remove or cap outliers using Z-score or IQR methods.
                        Feature Engineering:
                        Encode categorical variables using pd.get_dummies() or LabelEncoder.
                        Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
                        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                        Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
    2. Model Development
                  Algorithms:
                        Trained multiple regression models including:
                        Random Forest

                        XGBoost
                        LightGBM
                        Support Vector Regression
                        K-Nearest Neighbors
                        Hyperparameter Tuning:
                        Performed GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for each model.
                  Model Evaluation:
                        Compared models based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
    3. Feature Importance
                        Identified the most significant predictors of CO using feature importance plots.
                        Temperature, NO2, and humidity emerged as the strongest predictors.
    4. Evaluation on Unseen Data
                        Validated the best-performing model on unseen data to ensure generalizability and real-world application.
